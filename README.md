# AWS Practice Questions Web App

This project is a serverless web application designed to help users prepare for AWS certification exams. It features a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js.

## 🧠 Purpose

To provide aspiring AWS-certified professionals with a hands-on way to test and improve their knowledge using dynamic practice questions that simulate real exam scenarios.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ View randomized AWS practice questions
- ✅ Select and submit answers
- ✅ See feedback on correct/incorrect responses
- ✅ Backend API built with AWS Lambda
- ✅ Data stored in DynamoDB
- ✅ Deployed using AWS services (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

    |--> React (Frontend, hosted in S3 + CloudFront)
    |
    |--> API Gateway (REST API)
    |
    |--> AWS Lambda (Node.js)
    |
    |--> DynamoDB (Questions Table)
